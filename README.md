I run [Mile High Gliding](https://www.facebook.com/milehighgliding/). I used to write code... [I still do, too](https://github.com/bmershon).

I am a co-owner and pilot of [Boulder Pilot, LLC](https://www.boulderpilot.com), which offers transition training, ferry pilot services, and experimental flight test consultation based out of the Boulder/Denver area.

I currently fly a Pitts S1S, competing in the Rocky Mountain Chapter 12 of the International Aerobatic Club.

## [💻 Code](https://github.com/bmershon)

* [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bmershon) for longer projects. Some repos are actually teaching materials organized in the spirit of a software project, because teaching *is* programming. And I *love* teaching and explaining as I'm learning while leaving a record beind, if only to help [externalize memory](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/writing/).

* [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/bmershon) for interactive visuals, code snippets, and [bite-sized explainers](https://bl.ocks.org/bmershon/372fe12a6d2b560513b3aa8d6c5a4b31). Often made [to teach myself](https://bl.ocks.org/bmershon/d332ba9b06975562979efba7b367e162). These are updated frequently and more often than not reflect a day's effort at playing with a new idea. In the same veign as Mike Bostock's [examples](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/example/), these *blocks* help me to break a larger project into smaller self-contained explainers. It's a good day when I can upload another one of these; like building blocks, these tend to be part of larger and more involved structures.

* [Observable Notebooks](https://beta.observablehq.com/@bmershon). I have recently started producing interactive educational content on this platform in parallel with the material that I am currently self-studying. I learn best by examples. [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/) helps me build examples that keep on giving to both myself and others.

## [🌎 Publications](https://github.com/bmershon/washington-post-graphics/blob/master/README.md)

* [Static and Interactive illustrations](https://github.com/bmershon/washington-post-graphics/blob/master/README.md) for The Washington Post.
* [Pratt Education: The Online Revolution](https://dukelibraries.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15957coll16/id/9206) in Duke Engineer Magazine (2013).

## [📜 Essays](https://medium.com/me/stories/public)

*selected entries*

* [A Coding Maxim](https://medium.com/@BrooksMershon/a-coding-maxim-b0c2380f7532)
* [SIGGRAPH 2016 - A Wide Eyed Account](https://medium.com/@BrooksMershon/siggraph-2016-a-wide-eyed-account-24a5677b2c7a)

## [📚 Catalog](https://github.com/bmershon/catalog/wiki)

[Books](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Nonfiction-Books), [essays](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Essays), [films](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Films) and [other resources](https://github.com/bmershon/fieldnotes/wiki/Technical-Writing) I have found to be particularly great or enriching. Updated frequently.
